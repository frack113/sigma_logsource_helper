# sigma_logsource_helper
Small questions to help select the right logsource for effective detection

# Summary

These are questions for selecting the right logsource according to the available information sources.

There is no engine 
And it's a POC, an idea 

# logsource Yaml 

There are 2 parts in the file

- logsources : all the logsource found in the rules
- questions : a boolean question to take the list of logsource

`fhash` for "frack Hash" , is a way to check logsource with a simple string.
It is not pretty but it's works

# Missing

Add a file or a part to select only the correct questions to ask.
